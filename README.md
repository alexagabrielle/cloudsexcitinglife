## Cloud's Exciting Life

Cloud is a one year old Australian Shepherd from Orange County, California! He has a _very_ exciting life, which consists 4 things: eating, sleeping, playing, and bothering his sisters, Chloe and Zoe!

Here is a breakdown of his 4 daily activities:

### Eating

Cloud **LOVES** to eat. He would quite literally eating anything and everything. He has been caught eating toilet paper, dirt, sticks, his own toys, paper, and especially: chicken poop! His own dinner and treats aren't enough for cloud, he is constantly looking for other things to chew on!


### Sleeping 

Cloud also loves to sleep, especially after a long day of chasing dogs at the dog park. He finds comfy places in the most uncomfortable looking areas, such as the bathroom floor or in a ball under a chair. He sometimes sleeps on his back as well, and makes yapping noises as if he is dreaming! So cute!

### Playing

Of course, Cloud has so much fun playing with his human and doggy friends! He has a bunch of toys, and his favorites are stufed animals. However, he isn't allowed to play with them that much because he tears out the stuffing and makes a mess! At the dark park, Cloud tries really hard to be friends with all the doggies and get them to chase him! In his own backyard, there is a chicken coop with 3 chickens! He always seems eager to "play" with them, however, the humans think he has alterior motives...

### Bothering his sisters

Cloud has 2 sisters, Chloe and Zoe, who are cats. They are not very fond of Cloud, let alone anyone. They are still salty that he has taken over their territories, and often hiss or swipe at him as he continuously tries to get them to play with him!
